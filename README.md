# Thoughts

Even though tasks can be distributed in a good fashion, it's recommended to do the following:

* work in branches
* When you finish implementing raise a PR and notify someone to review. If you used another implementation as a reference link it. If you are doing adhoc work (creating a network for example) you can add notebooks or add comments to the PR. Having someone review is not that crucial, if you are interested in being involved and sharing knowledge with others it's a good approach.
* The skeleton implemented is not by any means something we should freeze. If you want to change something of another guys' code it's totally fine. However the first thing you do, change his code in a separate commit to make work cleaner. If you are implementing skip gram and you want to modify generator modify it in some commit push it then push your skip gram. 


# Todo
* Agree on task distribution
* Create a better communication channel than whatsapp
* Start doing actual work :) 
* Reserve sometime to communicate (preferably evening as 2 people are working)
